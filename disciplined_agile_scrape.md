Introduction to Disciplined Agile (DA)®
Disciplined Agile (DA) is a comprehensive decision framework and knowledge base, designed to guide individuals, teams, and entire organizations in optimizing their ways of working. It achieves this by organizing a wealth of proven practices and strategies drawn from diverse sources, including Agile methodologies, Lean principles, and even traditional approaches. Rather than prescribing a single, rigid process, DA's core philosophy is empowerment through informed choice. It helps users select and continuously evolve their Way of Working (WoW) to best suit the unique context and challenges they face, fostering pragmatic and context-sensitive process improvement.
The decision framework operates by making explicit the crucial process-related decisions that teams and organizations encounter. For each key decision point, DA presents a curated range of potential options—specific techniques or strategies—and importantly, illuminates the tradeoffs associated with each. This approach enables users to move beyond simplistic "best practices" and make choices that are genuinely fit-for-purpose, ultimately leading to better outcomes and enhanced organizational agility. Understanding the tradeoffs detailed for each option is key to leveraging the decision framework effectively.
Core Components of the Disciplined Agile Toolkit
The DA toolkit's guidance is delivered through several interconnected components that work together to provide a holistic view:
 
Figure 1. Goal, Decision Points, Options
At the heart of DA lies its Decision Framework, visualized through Goal Diagrams. These diagrams structure process knowledge logically, starting with a high-level Goal (such as "Address Risk" or "Coordinate Activities"). Each Goal encompasses several Decision Points, which represent critical aspects or questions that need consideration (for instance, "How will we identify risks?" or "How should we address a threat?"). For every Decision Point, DA catalogues potential Options – the specific practices or strategies available. These options might be ordered to suggest generally more effective choices, or unordered when context is the primary driver of suitability.
 
Figure 2. Universal Values for Better Outcomes
Underpinning the Disciplined Agile approach are fundamental values designed to guide decision-making and foster a culture conducive to success. Recognizing that complex frameworks of principles can be difficult to internalize and apply consistently, DA emphasizes four Universal Values for Better Outcomes. These values serve as a simple yet powerful compass for navigating choices and driving effective action across all domains and contexts:
•	Respect People & Planet: This value underscores the importance of considering the human element and environmental impact in all decisions and actions. It promotes creating sustainable, ethical, and collaborative environments where individuals can thrive and contribute their best work, while acknowledging broader responsibilities.
•	Optimize Value Delivery: This focuses attention on the primary goal – delivering meaningful value efficiently and effectively. It encourages streamlining processes, eliminating waste, prioritizing work based on impact, and ensuring that efforts are consistently aligned with producing tangible outcomes for stakeholders and customers.
•	Relentless Improvement: This value embeds the practice of continuous learning and adaptation into the way of working. It encourages constantly seeking opportunities to enhance processes, skills, and outcomes through experimentation, feedback, and reflection, fostering a dynamic and evolving organization.
•	Be Pragmatic: This emphasizes the need for realistic, context-sensitive solutions. It encourages making practical choices based on the specific situation faced, avoiding dogma, embracing flexibility, and selecting approaches that are genuinely workable and appropriate for achieving the desired results, rather than adhering rigidly to a predefined script.
These four universal values provide a foundational guide for applying the DA toolkit effectively, ensuring that process choices and improvement efforts remain grounded in principles that consistently lead to better performance and sustainable success.
 
 
Figure 3. end-to-end flow
A central focus of the Disciplined Agile toolkit is enhancing value delivery. It provides guidance to help organizations understand, visualize, and streamline their end-to-end flow of work – from initial concept through to the realization of value by the end customer. By applying DA's decision framework and knowledge base, organizations can analyze their value streams, identify critical bottlenecks and dependencies, and select appropriate practices to optimize how value is created and delivered across functional silos.
This emphasis on optimizing flow directly supports improvement at multiple levels. At the team level, DA provides the tools and techniques necessary to enhance team agility (tactical agility), helping individual teams refine their internal processes, collaboration, and responsiveness within the value stream while balancing governance and essential organizational compliance aspects. Concurrently, by addressing the connections and handoffs between teams and functions, DA enables organizations to advance their enterprise agility (strategic agility). This broader perspective involves optimizing how the entire system functions to deliver value effectively, align with strategic goals, and adapt successfully to market dynamics.
Applying Disciplined Agile: Improvement and Starting Points
DA provides practical methods for leveraging its knowledge base to drive tangible improvements and effectively initiate change:
 
Figure 4. Value Acceleration Process
The primary engine for continuous improvement within DA is the Value Acceleration Process (VAP). This is not a rigid procedure but a flexible, iterative approach adaptable to various situations. It follows three core steps:
1.	Establish Outcomes: Begin by collaboratively defining the specific, measurable results the improvement effort aims to achieve. This ensures shared understanding and focus.

2.	Conduct Discovery: Systematically identify the obstacles, challenges, bottlenecks, or opportunities that stand in the way of achieving the desired outcomes. Techniques like brainstorming and root cause analysis are often employed here.

3.	Work the Plan: Use the DA knowledge base, particularly the Goal Diagrams, to explore and select relevant practices (Options) that can effectively address the items identified during Discovery. Implement these chosen practices iteratively, creating an improvement backlog, assigning ownership, monitoring results, and adapting the plan based on feedback and learning.
 
 
Figure 5. Disciplined Agile Ways of Working Spectrum & Quick Starts
To help teams and organizations overcome the initial hurdle of "Where do I begin?", the DA toolkit includes Quick Starts. These are pre-defined configurations designed for specific, common contexts or use-cases, such as initiating a new agile project or setting up a basic team workflow. Each Quick Start provides a recommended minimal set of initial practices drawn from the DA knowledge base, offering a pragmatic "good enough to start" WoW suggestion. They act as practical accelerators, enabling quicker adoption of DA concepts in familiar situations. Initial Quick Starts support multiple points along the DA ways of working spectrum, including agile approaches and hybrids that move you closer to agile.  The library of Quick Starts is intended to expand over time as new common patterns emerge from real-world DA applications.
Accelerating Value Delivery: The VSM Adoption Spectrum
Optimize End to End Flow with Value Stream Management
A key part of improving value delivery is optimizing the end to end flow of each value stream—a discipline known as Value Stream Management (VSM). By visualizing how ideas move from concept to consumable value, organizations can expose delays, hand backs, and waste, then systematically remove them to shorten time to value.
Start Where You Are and Improve Incrementally
The DA Value Acceleration Process (VAP)—Establish Outcomes → Conduct Discovery → Work the Plan—operates at two complementary levels, each with a distinct focus and horizon:
 
The same three steps scale from the team room to the board room—providing a common cadence for learning and adaptation
Context Drives Choice
Because every organization’s constraints, culture, and market pressures are unique, the exact improvement path will differ. DA’s context sensitive decision framework helps leaders make informed, pragmatic choices that fit their situation.
The DA VSM Adoption Spectrum
 
Figure 6. These phases are waypoints, not gates; organizations may advance unevenly across different value streams
Real world experience shows a common pattern of capability growth that can be grouped into four broad phases:
 
Value & Innovation Increments
 
Figure 7. Innovation Increments & Value Increments
To focus improvement work, DA distinguishes two complementary types of increments:
•	Value Increment (VI) – a fully consumable slice of measurable value delivered to a customer or internal stakeholder.

•	Innovation Increment (II) – an experiment designed to validate an idea and reduce uncertainty.

Both increments flow through the same value stream; VIs emphasize delivery, while IIs emphasize learning.
Learning the How: DA Leadership—Value Delivery for Enterprise Agility
The new course (coming soon) “DA Leadership: Value Delivery for Enterprise Agility” equips change leaders with the skills to apply the DA Knowledge Base, VAP, and the Adoption Spectrum to accelerate flow and unlock enterprise wide agility.
Summary
In essence, Disciplined Agile offers a pragmatic, flexible, and context-sensitive alternative to rigid, prescriptive approaches. Through its structured decision framework, extensive knowledge base, a guiding Mindset, and practical application methods like the Value Acceleration Process and Quick Starts, DA empowers organizations to consciously choose and evolve their Way of Working. By clarifying concepts like Value Increments and Innovation Increments, it sharpens the focus on both efficiently delivering value and effectively exploring new opportunities, ultimately enabling organizations to continuously learn, adapt, and thrive in their unique circumstances.

The Disciplined Agile® (DA™) tool kit is architected. What we mean by this is we have carefully worked through how to organize and capture the material in the tool kit. The architecture of the tool kit is depicted in Figure 1. There are three architectural concepts to be aware of: 
•	Layers. An architectural layer is a cohesive subset of the DA tool kit which builds upon the layer immediately “below” it. As you see in Figure 1 the layers build upon each other, starting with the Foundation layer, then Disciplined DevOps, then Value Streams, then Disciplined Agile Enterprise (DAE).
•	Views. Architectural views are themes that cut across all layers of the DA tool kit. As you see in Figure 1 there are four views. In order of importance, they are Mindset, People, Flow, and Practices.
•	Process blades. Process blades are sometimes referred to as process areas, business functions, or even key process areas.
 
Figure 1. The architecture of the DA tool kit.
Why is process architecture important?  We believe there are several reasons:
•	Consistency. Having a solid architecture enables us to present the DA tool kit in a consistent manner.
•	Consumability. As the consistency within the DA tool kit increases, particularly with how it is rendered here on the web site, it becomes easier to work with and to understand.
Extensibility. The DA tool kit is continually evolving, and as a result we are highly motivated to ensure that is as easy as possible to update and extend.

About
About Disciplined Agile (DA)®
DA is a process-decision toolkit that provides straightforward and practical guidance to help individuals, teams and enterprises optimize their Way of Working (WoW) in a context-specific way.
Key principles of DA include customer centricity, pragmatism, flexibility in methodology (supporting a range of agile and lean options), and the application of context-based practices that optimize flow across the entire enterprise. Applying the DA toolkit allows organizations to customize any method or framework—including traditional, Scrum, or SAFe—to drive outcomes that differentiate them from their competitors.
History of DA
The Disciplined Agile approach was co-created in 2012 by Scott Ambler and Mark Lines. Their goal was to offer a much-need, flexible approach to problem solving that recognizes that every organization is different, and that even within each organization there are different ways of working. The DA approach allows individuals, teams, and enterprises to tailor solutions to fit their needs, or WoW.
Since its inception, Lines and Ambler have published five books on DA, established the DA Consortium, and provided strategic consulting and training on the DA approach. Prior to its acquisition, DA had more than 12,000 practitioners in 30 countries have been trained in Disciplined Agile and over 50,000 Disciplined Agile books have been sold.

How DA Fits in with PMI
In August 2019, PMI announced the acquisition of DA. The combination of these two organizations offers a unique and unparalleled value proposition to stakeholders who are committed to improving their personal, team, and enterprise agility.

By leveraging Disciplined Agile:
•	PMI members gain access to strong, credible new capabilities and certifications that will differentiate them and open doors
•	Current agile practitioners can leverage a more mindful, tailored approach to agility, driven by an agile and lean mindset and enabled by processes that fit their context
•	Enterprises around the world can enjoy a more tailored approach to enterprise agility based on their specific needs and context
•	PMI and DA partners have access to an expanded set of product offerings for their stakeholders and customers
•	Both PMI and DA members receive access to both organizations’ frameworks and online content, as well as the richness that comes with a broad-based, diverse community


Regardless of traditional or agile approaches, project or product, PMI now has guidance to help organizations and teams be more successful.

Principles
•	Principle: Delight Customers
•	Principle: Be Awesome

•	Principle: Optimize Flow
•	Principle: Organize Around Products/Services
•	Principle: Enterprise Awareness
Click on a mindset aspect for more information.
The principles of the Disciplined Agile® (DA™) mindset provide a philosophical foundation for business agility. They are based on both lean and flow concepts. These principles are:
1.	Delight customers. We need to go beyond satisfying our customers' needs, beyond meeting their expectations and strive to delight them. If we don't then someone else will delight them and steal our customers away from us. This applies to both external customers as well as internal customers.
2.	Be awesome. We should always strive to be the best that we can and to always get better. Who wouldn't want to work with awesome people, on an awesome team for an awesome organization?
3.	Context counts. Every person, every team, every organization is unique. We face unique situations that evolve over time. The implication is that we must choose our way of working (WoW) to reflect the context that we face, and then evolve our WoW as the situation evolves.
4.	Be pragmatic. Our aim isn't to be agile, it's to be as effective as we can be and to improve from there. To do this we need to be pragmatic and adopt agile, lean, or even traditional strategies when they make the most sense for our context. In the past, we called this principle “Pragmatism.”
5.	Choice is good. To choose our WoW in a context-driven, pragmatic manner we need to select the best-fit technique given our situation. Having choices, and knowing the trade-offs associated with those choices, is critical to choosing our WoW that is the best fit for our context.
6.	Optimize flow. We want to optimize flow across the value stream that we are part of, and better yet across our organization, and not just locally optimize our WoW within our team. Sometimes this will be a bit inconvenient for us, but overall we will be able to more effectively respond to our customers.
7.	Organize around products/services (new). To delight our customers we need to organize ourselves around producing the offerings, the products and services, that they need. We are in effect organizing around value streams because value streams produce value for customers, both external and internal, in the form of products and services. We chose to say organize around products/services, rather than offerings or value streams, as we felt this was more explicit.
8.	Enterprise awareness. Disciplined agilists look beyond the needs of their team to take the long-term needs of their organization into account. They adopt, and sometimes tailor, organizational guidance. They follow and provide feedback too, organizational roadmaps. They leverage, and sometimes enhance, existing organizational assets. In short, they do what's best for the organization and not just what's convenient for them.

•	Disciplined Agile® Promises
Promises
•	Promise: Create Psychological Safety and Embrace Diversity
•	Promise: Accelerate Value Realization
•	Promise: Collaborate Proactively
•	Promise: Make All Work and Workflow Visible
•	Promise: Improve Predictability
•	Promise: Keep Workloads Within Capacity
•	Promise: Improve Continuously
Click on a mindset aspect for more information.
The promises of the Disciplined Agile® (DA™) mindset are agreements that we make with our fellow teammates, our stakeholders, and other people within our organization with whom we interact. The promises define a collection of disciplined behaviors that enable us to collaborate effectively and professionally. The seven promises are:
1.	Create psychological safety and embrace diversity. Psychological safety means being able to show and apply oneself without fear of negative consequences of status, career, or self-worth—we should be comfortable being ourselves in our work setting. Psychological safety goes hand-in-hand with diversity, which is the recognition that everyone is unique and can add value in different ways. The dimensions of personal uniqueness include, but are not limited to, race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, agile, physical abilities, socioeconomic status, religious beliefs, political beliefs, and other ideological beliefs. Diversity is critical to a team’s success because it enables greater innovation. The more diverse our team, the better our ideas will be, the better our work will be, and the more we’ll learn from each other. 
2.	Accelerate value realization. In DA we use the term value to refer to both customer and business value. Customer value, something that benefits the end customer who consumes the product/service that our team helps to provide, is what agilists typically focus on. This is clearly important, but in Disciplined Agile we’re very clear that teams have a range of stakeholders, including external end customers. Business value addresses the issue that some things are of benefit to our organization and perhaps only indirectly to our customers. For example, investing in enterprise architecture, in reusable infrastructure, and in sharing innovations across our organization offer the potential to improve consistency, quality, reliability, and reduce cost over the long term. 
3.	Collaborate proactively. Disciplined agilists strive to add value to the whole, not just to their individual work or to the team’s work. The implication is that we want to collaborate both within our team and with others outside our team, and we also want to be proactive doing so. Waiting to be asked is passive, observing that someone needs help and then volunteering to do so is proactive.  
4.	Make all work and workflow visible. DA teams will often make their work visible at both the individual level as well as the team level. It is critical to focus on our work in process, which is our work in progress plus any work that is queued up waiting for us to get to it. Furthermore, DA teams make their workflow visible, and thus have explicit workflow policies, so that everyone knows how everyone else is working.  
5.	Improve predictability. DA teams strive to improve their predictability to enable them to collaborate and self-organize more effectively, and thereby to increase the chance that they will fulfill any commitments that they make to their stakeholders. Many of the earlier promises we have made work toward improving predictability.  
6.	Keep workloads within capacity. Going beyond capacity is problematic from both a personal and a productivity point of view. At the personal level, overloading a person or team will often increase the frustration of the people involved. Although it may motivate some people to work harder in the short term, it will cause burnout in the long term, and it may even motivate people to give up and leave because the situation seems hopeless to them. From a productivity point of view, overloading causes multitasking, which increases overall overhead.  
7.	Improve continuously. The really successful organizations—Apple, Amazon, eBay, Facebook, Google, and more—got that way through continuous improvement. They realized that to remain competitive they needed to constantly look for ways to improve their processes, the outcomes that they were delivering to their customers, and their organizational structures.

•	Disciplined Agile® Guidelines

Guidelines
•	Guideline: Validate Our Learnings
•	Guideline: Apply Design Thinking
•	Guideline: Attend to Relationships Through the Value Stream
•	Guideline: Create Effective Environments That Foster Joy
•	Guideline: Change Culture by Improving the System
•	Guideline: Create Semi-Autonomous, Self-Organizing Teams
•	Guideline: Adopt Measures to Improve Outcomes
•	Guideline: Leverage and Enhance Organizational Assets
Click on a mindset aspect for more information.
The guidelines of the Disciplined Agile® (DA™) mindset help us to be more effective in our way of working (WoW) and in improving our WoW over time. These guidelines are:
1.	Validate our learnings. The only way to become awesome is to experiment with, and then adopt where appropriate, a new WoW. In guided continuous improvement (GCI) we experiment with a new way of working and then we assess how well it worked, an approach called validated learning. Being willing and able to experiment is critical to our process-improvement efforts.
2.	Apply design thinking. Delighting customers requires us to recognize that our aim is to create operational value streams that are designed with our customers in mind. This requires design thinking on our part. Design thinking means to be empathetic to the customer, to first try to understand their environment and their needs before developing a solution.
3.	Attend to relationships through the value stream. The interactions between the people doing the work are what is key, regardless of whether or not they are part of the team. For example, when a product manager needs to work closely with our organization’s data analytics team to gain a better understanding of what is going on in the marketplace, and with our strategy team to help put those observations into context, then we want to ensure that these interactions are effective.
4.	Create effective environments that foster joy. Part of being awesome is having fun and being joyful. We want to work in our company to be a great experience so we can attract and keep the best people. Done right, work is play. We can make our work more joyful by creating an environment that allows us to work together well.
5.	Change culture by improving the system. While culture is important, and culture change is a critical component of any organization’s agile transformation, the unfortunate reality is that we can't change it directly. This is because the culture is a reflection of the management system in place, so to change our culture we need to evolve our overall system.
6.	Create semi-autonomous self-organizing teams. Organizations are complex adaptive systems (CASs) made up of a network of teams or, if you will, a team of teams. Although mainstream agile implores us to create “whole teams” that have all of the skills and resources required to achieve the outcomes that they’ve been tasked with, the reality is that no team is an island unto itself. Autonomous teams would be ideal but there are always dependencies on other teams upstream that we are part of, as well as downstream from us. And, of course, there are dependencies between offerings (products or services) that necessitate the teams responsible for them to collaborate.
7.	Adopt measures to improve outcomes. When it comes to measurement, context counts. What are we hoping to improve? Quality? Time to market? Staff morale? Customer satisfaction? Combinations thereof? Every person, team, and the organization has their own improvement priorities, and their own ways of working, so they will have their own set of measures that they gather to provide insight into how they’re doing and, more importantly, how to proceed. And these measures evolve over time as their situation and priorities evolve. The implication is that our measurement strategy must be flexible and fit for purpose, and it will vary across teams.
8.	Leverage and enhance organizational assets. Our organization has many assets—information systems, information sources, tools, templates, procedures, learnings, and other things—that our team could adopt to improve our effectiveness. We may not only choose to adopt these assets, we may also find that we can improve them to make them better for us as well as other teams who also choose to work with these assets.
  
Figure 2. Universal Values for Better Outcomes
Underpinning the Disciplined Agile approach are fundamental values designed to guide decision-making and foster a culture conducive to success. Recognizing that complex frameworks of principles can be difficult to internalize and apply consistently, DA emphasizes four Universal Values for Better Outcomes. These values serve as a simple yet powerful compass for navigating choices and driving effective action across all domains and contexts:
•	Respect People & Planet: This value underscores the importance of considering the human element and environmental impact in all decisions and actions. It promotes creating sustainable, ethical, and collaborative environments where individuals can thrive and contribute their best work, while acknowledging broader responsibilities.

•	Optimize Value Delivery: This focuses attention on the primary goal – delivering meaningful value efficiently and effectively. It encourages streamlining processes, eliminating waste, prioritizing work based on impact, and ensuring that efforts are consistently aligned with producing tangible outcomes for stakeholders and customers.

•	Relentless Improvement: This value embeds the practice of continuous learning and adaptation into the way of working. It encourages constantly seeking opportunities to enhance processes, skills, and outcomes through experimentation, feedback, and reflection, fostering a dynamic and evolving organization.

•	Be Pragmatic: This emphasizes the need for realistic, context-sensitive solutions. It encourages making practical choices based on the specific situation faced, avoiding dogma, embracing flexibility, and selecting approaches that are genuinely workable and appropriate for achieving the desired results, rather than adhering rigidly to a predefined script.
These four universal values provide a foundational guide for applying the DA toolkit effectively, ensuring that process choices and improvement efforts remain grounded in principles that consistently lead to better performance and sustainable success.

People First
People, and how they work together, are the primary determinants of success.
In Disciplined Agile® (DA™), we have always promoted a “people first” philosophy. This shows in the DA principles of be awesome and delight customers, the DA promises to create psychological safety and embrace diversity, and the DA guidelines to create effective environments that foster joy and create semi-autonomous, self-organizing teams.

•	Core developer skills reading path
•	Developer reading path
•	Disciplined Agile Delivery (DAD)
•	Product owner reading path
•	Team lead reading path
•	Tester reading path
Primary roles are commonly found regardless of the level of scale. There are five primary roles:
1.	Stakeholder. A stakeholder is someone who is materially impacted by the outcome of the solution. In this regard, the stakeholder is clearly more than an end-user: A stakeholder could be a direct user, indirect user, manager of users, senior manager, operations staff member, the “gold owner” who funds the project, support (help desk) staff member, auditors, your program/portfolio manager, developers working on other systems that integrate or interact with the one under development, maintenance professionals potentially affected by the development and/or deployment of a software project. DAD teams will ideally work together with their stakeholders daily throughout the project.
2.	Team Member. The role of team member focuses on producing the actual solution for stakeholders. Team members will perform testing, analysis, architecture, design, programming, planning, estimation, and many more activities as appropriate throughout the project. Note that not every team member will have every single one of these skills, at least not yet, but they will have a subset of them, and they will strive to gain more skills over time. Team members are sometimes described by core agile methods as “developers” or simply as programmers. However, in DAD we recognize that not every team member necessarily writes code. Team members will identify tasks, estimate tasks, “sign-up” for tasks, perform the tasks, and track their status towards completion.
3.	Team Lead. An important aspect of self-organizing teams is that the team lead facilitates or guides the team in performing technical management activities instead of taking on these responsibilities him or herself. The team lead is a servant-leader of the team, creating and maintaining the conditions that allow the team to be successful. The team lead is also an agile coach, helping to keep the team focused on delivering work items and fulfilling their iteration goals and commitments that they have made to the product owner. He or she acts as a true leader, facilitating communication, empowering them to self-optimize their processes, ensuring that the team has the resources that it needs, and removes any impediments to the team (issue resolution) in a timely manner. When teams are self-organizing, effective leadership is crucial to your success.
4.	Product Owner. In a system with hundreds or thousands of requirements it is often difficult to get answers to questions regarding the requirements. The product owner is the one individual on the team who speaks as the “one voice of the customer.” He or she represents the needs and desires of the stakeholder community to the agile delivery team. As such, he or she clarifies any details regarding the solution and is also responsible for maintaining a prioritized list of work items that the team will implement to deliver the solution. While the product owner may not be able to answer all questions, it is their responsibility to track down the answer in a timely manner so that the team can stay focused on their tasks. Having a product owner working closely with the team to answer any question about work items as they are being implemented substantially reduces the need for requirements, testing, and design documentation. You will of course still have need for deliverable documentation such as operations manuals, support manuals, and user guides to name a few. Each DAD team, or sub-team in the case of large programs organized into a team of teams, has a single product owner. A secondary goal for a product owner is to represent the work of the agile team to the stakeholder community. This includes arranging demonstrations of the solution as it evolves and communicating project status to key stakeholders.
5.	Architecture Owner. Architecture is a key source of project risk and someone needs to be responsible for ensuring the team mitigates this risk. As a result DAD explicitly includes Agile Modeling’s role of architecture owner. The architecture owner is the person who owns the architecture decisions for the team and who facilitates the creation and evolution of the overall solution design. The person in the role of team lead will often also be in the role of architecture owner on small teams. This isn’t always the case, particularly at scale, but it is very common for smaller agile teams. Although the architecture owner is typically the senior developer on the team – and sometimes may be known as the technical architect, software architect, or solution architect – it should be noted that this is not a hierarchical position into which other team members report. He or she is just like any other team member and is expected to sign-up and deliver work related to tasks like any other team member. Architecture owners should have a technical background and a solid understanding of the business domain.
Supporting Roles
Supporting roles (formerly called secondary roles) are typically introduced, often on a temporary basis, to address scaling issues. There are five supporting roles:
1.	Specialist. Although most agile team members are generalizing specialists, sometimes, particularly at scale, specialists are required. For example, on large teams or in complex domains one or more agile business analysts may join the team to help you to explore the requirements for what you’re building. On very large teams a program manager may be required to coordinate the team leads on various subteams/squads. You will also see specialists on DAD teams when generalizing specialists aren’t available – when your organization is new to agile it may be staffed primarily with specialists who haven’t yet made the transition to generalizing specialists.
2.	Domain Expert (or subject matter expert). The product owner represents a wide range of stakeholders, not just end users, so it isn’t reasonable to expect them to be experts in every nuance in your domain, something that is particularly true with complex domains. The product owner will sometimes bring in domain experts to work with the team, for example, a tax expert to explain the details of a requirement or the sponsoring executive to explain the vision for the project.
3.	Technical Expert. Sometimes the team needs the help of technical experts, such as a build master to set up their build scripts, an agile database administrator to help design and test their database, a user experience (UX) expert to help design a usable interface, or a security expert to provide advice around writing a secure system. Technical experts are brought in on an as-needed, temporary basis to help the team overcome a difficult problem and to transfer their skills to one or more developers on the team. Technical experts are often working on other teams that are responsible for enterprise-level technical concerns or are simply specialists on loan to your team from other delivery teams.
4.	Independent Tester. Although the majority of the testing is done by the people on the DAD team themselves, some DAD teams are supported by an independent test team working in parallel that validates their work throughout the life cycle. This independent test team is typically needed for agility at scale situations within complex domains, using complex technology, or addressing regulatory compliance issues.
5.	Integrator. For large DAD teams which have been organized into a team of sub-teams, the sub-teams are typically responsible for one or more subsystems or features. The larger the overall team, generally the larger and more complicated the system being built. In these situations, the overall team may require one or more people in the role of integrator responsible for building the entire system from its various subsystems. On smaller teams or in simpler situations the Architecture Owner is typically responsible for ensuing integration, a responsibility that is picked up by the integrator(s) for more complex environments. Integrators often work closely with the independent test team, if there is one, to perform system integration testing regularly throughout the project. This integrator role is typically only needed at scale for complex technical solutions.
Why So Many Roles?
This is a common question that we get from people familiar with Scrum. Scrum has three roles – ScrumMaster, Product Owner, and Team Member – so why does DAD need ten? The primary issue is one of scope. Scrum mostly focuses on leadership and change management aspects during Construction and therefore has roles which reflect this. DAD, on the other hand, explicitly focuses on the full delivery life cycle and all aspects of solution delivery, including the technical aspects that Scrum leaves out. So, with a larger scope comes more roles. For example, because DAD encompasses agile architecture issues it includes an Architecture Owner role. Scrum doesn’t address architecture so doesn’t include such a role.
Some Important Thoughts About Roles
On a DAD team, any given person will be in one or more roles, an individual can change their role(s) over time, and any given role will have zero or more people performing it at any given time. For example, Peter may be in the role of team member and architecture owner right now but step into the role of team lead next month when Carol, the existing team lead, goes on vacation.
Roles are not positions, nor are they meant to be. For example, Jane may be in the role of stakeholder for your project but have the position of Chief Financial Officer (CFO) within your organization. In fact, although there may be hundreds of stakeholders of your project none of them is likely to have a position of “stakeholder.”
Agile de-emphasizes specialized roles and considers all team members equal – everyone pitches in to deliver a working solution regardless of their job description. An implication of this is that with the exception of stakeholder everyone is effectively in the role of team member.
Traditional roles, such as business analyst and project manager, do not appear in DAD. The goals which people in traditional roles try to achieve, for example in the case of a business analyst to understand and communicate the stakeholder needs/intent for the solution, are still addressed in DAD but in different ways by different roles. There isn’t a perfect one-to-one match between any given traditional role and a DAD role, but as you will find in Choose Your WoW! there are reasonable transition strategies. The critical thing for traditionalists to understand is that because the underlying paradigm and strategy has changed, they too must change to reflect the DAD approach.

•	Tactical Scaling Roles
•	Disciplined DevOps Roles
•	Value Stream Roles
•	Disciplined Enterprise (DAE) Roles
•	Critical Concepts About Roles
When you scale agile strategically to address the needs of your entire enterprise, a multitude of roles appear. The reason why there are so many roles at scale is due to the breadth of activities that occur throughout a modern enterprise. Every single process blade introduces one or more specialist roles. For example, the Portfolio Management blade introduces the role of Portfolio Manager/Coordinator and the Operations blade introduces Operations Manager and Operations Engineer. As your scope widens to address agility across your entire organization, you find that you also need to address a correspondingly wide range of roles than what you typically find in narrowly focused agile methods or frameworks. 
The primary danger of having defined roles is that they will be perceived as positions. When this happens the natural tendency is for people to start adding activities around the position so as to make it more important. In the case of a management position the tendency is to increase the number of people reporting into the position so as to increase the influence of the manger. 
It is important to realize that we are describing roles, not positions, in this article. Any person may take on one or more roles and they will change the roles that they take on over time. Any given role will have zero or more people fulfilling it at any given time, and that will also evolve as needed.

Rights and Responsibilities
Share

Post

Becoming agile requires a culture change within your organization, and all cultures have rules, some explicit and some implicit, so that everyone understands their expected behavior. One way to define expected behavior is to negotiate the rights and responsibilities that people on agile teams have. Interestingly, a lot of very good thinking on this topic was done in the Extreme Programming (XP) method, ideas which we’ve evolved for Disciplined Agile® (DA™).
The following lists of potential rights and responsibilities are meant to act as a potential starting point for your team. We’ve found that it’s very effective to get the team together, discuss these potential rights and responsibilities, and collaboratively evolve them to meet your needs. We also found that many organizations will first evolve this list to reflect their desired corporate culture, then provide it to teams to modify as appropriate for their specific situation. Note that we use the term “potential” reluctantly – our experience is that the rights and responsibilities described below work very well in practice and that very little tailoring, if at all, should be required.
Potential Rights of Agile Team Members
As an agile team member, we have the right to:
•	Be treated with respect. Let people be heard, don’t talk over people, listen to what they have to say, no name calling, and so on. Every one of your team mates brings something of value to the team so show them the respect you expect in return.
•	Work in a “safe environment.” This goes hand in hand with treating people with respect. Everyone needs to feel they are in a psychologically safe environment, that they can offer input without being mocked or ridiculed. For everyone to freely collaborate they need to know that their input is valued.
•	Produce and receive quality work based upon agreed standards. Establish the work standards up front. Make sure everyone on the team understands the standards and agrees to the standards. No one can be expected to meet moving standards.
•	Own the estimation process. The people doing the work get to estimate that work, resulting in more realistic estimates that people are willing to commit to. Estimates should not be imposed on the team.
•	Determine how the team will work together. The team has the right to determine who is going to work on what task when. The team knows the strengths and weaknesses of the team better than anyone else so they know best, how to meet the team goals
•	Be provided good faith information and decisions in timely manner. For the team to be effective they need good information to work with and information must be available when they need it. Any delays in providing requirements or answers to questions will reduce team productivity.
•	Choose and evolve our way of working (WoW). Teams should be allowed to work in the most effective way they can given the situation that they face. In agile we call this “owning your process” or “choosing your WoW.” DA helps teams to understand the process-related decisions they need to make, potential options to choose from, and the trade-offs of those options.
 
Potential Responsibilities of Agile Team Members
To misquote Uncle Ben Parker, with great rights come great responsibilities. Agile team members have the responsibility to:
•	Optimize their WoW. Optimizing how we work together should be looked at from a long term perspective. Allowing a specialist to take on a particular type of task may seem optimal in the short term because the task is done quickly. In the long term it may be more optimal to ask someone to pair with the specialist, even if it takes longer to complete the current task, to allow them to pick up new skills.
•	Be willing to collaborate extensively within your team, including those outside your specialty. Gone are the days when a developer could go hide in a corner and hack away at code. Collaboration is required across all team members.
•	Share all information including “work in progress. ” One of the keys to successful agility is transparency. If you run into a problem, tell the team so they can help out or at least re-plan. If you complete something quickly, tell the team so they can work on next steps whether that be: testing, or documenting or promoting. Everyone should know what everyone on the team is doing all the time.
•	Coach others in your skills and experience. The goal is to increase the skill set of everyone on the team so be prepared to teach your skills to the other team members. Previously the performance of people was assessed on their ability to perform specialty tasks. The focus needs to shift to how well a person collaborates, shares and increases the teams ability to perform.
•	Expand your knowledge and skills outside your specialty. Again, the goal is to increase the skill set of everyone including you so everyone needs to be open to learning new skills so they can help the team do every required task.
•	Validate your work as early as possible, working with others to do so. No more writing code and getting it promoted directly to production or producing documents that haven’t been reviewed. All code should be reviewed by another developer; non-solo strategies such as pairing or mobbing are great for this because it reduces the feedback loop to almost zero since several sets of eyes are always on the code . And all code needs to be tested against the acceptance criteria in the user story. Nothing goes out without someone else on the team reviewing it because it is a team responsibility to ensure quality.
•	Attend co-ordination meetings in person or through other means if not collocated. The co-ordination meeting is the most important meeting of the day and nothing else takes priority. Get to the meeting and get there on time. If you are late then you are holding up the whole team.
•	Proactively look for ways to improve team performance. The retrospectives are designed to fix and improve the team’s process. Come prepared to the meeting to discuss how the recent work went and talk about things that went wrong and how to fix them.
•	Avoid accepting work outside of the current iteration without consent from the team. For teams following an agile lifecycle (Agile, Continuous Delivery: Agile) commit to complete a specific bundle of work when they start an iteration. That means that all team members have made a commitment to complete all the work in the iteration. If you as a team member take on work from outside the iteration (whether it be from a colleague or an old boss or your current boss) then it means you are not working on tasks for the iteration and you are letting your team down. You should refuse all outside requests for your time. If that doesn’t work tell them they need to talk to the team lead. The team lead should refuse the request. If that doesn’t work then tell them to talk to the Product Owner. The Product Owner should refuse the request but offer to write it up and put it onto the backlog for consideration.



Communities of Practice (CoPs)
Share

Post

Not so long ago most traditional organizations had their engineering department organized by functions (business analysts, programming, testing/QA, and build). Although this slowed us down from delivering a potentially shippable piece of work and a time boxed iteration because of the handoffs between the functions, it did allow for greater collaboration within those functions to evolve their competencies and knowledge more easily.
As traditional functional departments are being reorganized into the cross functional teams to deliver more rapidly people within these functions/capabilities are dispersed across the organization which makes it hard for them to collaborate to leverage proven practices let alone evolve time. To remedy this organizations establish Communities of Practice (CoPs). A CoP is the means to foster social learning that occurs and shared practices that emerge and evolve when people who are distributed throughout an organization and have shared passion and expertise to collaborate to evolve these practices.
In many ways a CoP is a collection of people who share a craft or profession who have banded together to ‘learn’ from each other to develop themselves and often even the organization. CoPs are also known as Communities of Excellence (which should not be confused with Centers of Excellence, discussed later), Interest Leagues (not to be confused with The Justice League) or even guilds. We’ve seen CoPs focused on agile software development, testing, architecture, management, coaching, business analysis, DevOps, and many more.
This article addresses the following topics:
•	Why CoPs?
•	Forming a CoP
•	Workflow of a CoP
•	The Structure of a CoP
•	CoPs and Other Teams
 
Why CoPs?
There are many skills and experiences to learn from each other throughout the organization. Establishing and participating in these groups will give us a conduit to leverage this knowledge across the organization. A CoP forms when people recognize the need to help one another learn a topic. This falls into three major areas:
1.	Sharing techniques with one another. The Continuous Improvement goal diagram below captures many process improvement strategies, including strategies to share improvements or strategies. CoP members will often share techniques with one another through face-to-face conversations (perhaps a lean coffee session), chatting in discussion forums, practitioner presentations (such as a lunch-time presentation).
2.	Supporting one another’s learning. The goal diagram also captures several strategies that CoP members may choose to employ to support one another, in particular coaching and mentoring. Although a Center of Excellence (CoE) within your organization may officially be responsible for coaching and mentoring, and for most of the potential activities captured by the goal diagram, you will often see members of a CoP doing this as well in an informal manner. This is particularly true when no CoE exists for a given topic.
3.	Capture techniques. Some CoPs will choose to start capturing the techniques and strategies that they learn and share with one another, typically in an informal manner using either a wiki or documentation repository such as Microsoft Sharepoint.

As you can see the Continuous Improvement goal diagram above captures far more than just the activities that a CoP may choose to perform. This is because CoPs are one of several strategies that you may choose to adopt to promote continuous improvement within your organization.
Workflow of a CoP
It is common for a CoP to meet regularly as a group to discuss common challenges, frustrations, and ideas to improve on these. Out of this is usually a backlog populated with experiments to try to improve on these challenges are frustrations. Some of these meetings turn into working sessions where they flush these experiments out to begin using them. The feedback from running these experiments are discussed in a follow-up meeting to determine whether it makes sense to tweak (inspect and adapt) or to focus on another experiment to solve that particular challenge. The regular CoP meeting serves as a feedback loop to allow the group to continually build on the learning. New practices emerge, practices refined, new tools emerge, new configurations, and the basis of continuous improvement. The results of these meetings feed into other learning mechanisms such as lean coffees, lunch and learns, book clubs or knowledge bases.
Forming a CoP
CoPs are typically formed via two strategies:
•	Ad hoc. The first, and most common, is in an ad-hoc manner when practitioners realize that they have a common interest in learning and decide to support one another in doing so. The group will typically start meeting physically, perhaps in your cafeteria or cafe, or perhaps one of your meeting rooms. When it becomes clear the CoP is needed, the next step is to start putting internal support mechanisms in place such as discussion forums.
•	Supported. The second strategy is when an existing Center of Excellence (CoE) around a topic decides to support a CoP around the topic that they are tasked to support within your organization. For example, an Agile CoE may decide to start up an Agile CoP, an Agile Business Analysis CoP, or an Agile Architecture CoP. An architecture CoE may decide to start up an Agile Architecture CoP, a TOGAF CoP, or a Microservices Architecture CoP.
The Structure of CoPs
Structures of CoPs tend to be fairly fluid, with a leadership team initially composed of the most experienced members who work together to organize and support the overall effort. However, you usually want a balance of distribution of experience. If it is only comprised of the most experienced members you lose the chance of new innovative ideas/concepts/practices. If all/most are the most experienced they tend to defend the existing practices/ideas as they likely were the ones that brought them to the org. They should have a set tenure to allow for continuity. Then you can replenish it with new people ideas annually or semi-annually. The CoP leader, if there is one, typically emerges from within although sometimes that person is assigned at first if the team has been created by a CoE.
Membership in a CoP is voluntary. As a result members will come and go as they see fit and participate as much as they are willing to or have the time to. A given individual will be a member of zero or more CoPs, and our advice is to be a member of at least two CoPs: One for your current focus and one on the topic of what you hope your next focus will be.
CoPs and Other Teams
CoPs have close relationships with, and overlapping membership with, two other types of teams:
1.	Centers of Excellence (CoEs). A CoE is a group of people with specialized skills and expertise whose job is to provide leadership and purposely disseminate that knowledge within your organization. The primary difference between a CoE and a CoP is that a CoE is often purposefully created by an organization with funded members whose full-time job is to coach, teach, and mentor people. CoEs may also take on internal certification of people within your organization. CoEs are often created to support an organizational goal (such as an agile transformation) for a short period of time, perhaps several months or a few years, and then disbanded. CoPs, because of their voluntary nature, often last much longer and may be the end result of a CoE once its official funding disappears.
2.	Work teams. Very often there will be work teams within your organization whose purpose is to perform the some or all of the work activities supported by a CoP. For example, your organization may have an Enterprise Architecture (EA) team (or simply an architecture team) whose actual purpose is to evolve and support your EA strategy. In parallel you may also have an Architecture CoP helping people to learn and share architecture skills. Similarly you may have a Data Management team and a Data CoP, a Portfolio Management team and a Management CoP, and many others. Note that a CoE is a type of work team.
The diagram below shows an example of how people can be a member of several teams at the same time. Note that the diagram uses UML notation, in this case a line with a diamond on it, to indicate that someone is part of, or more accurately a member of, a team. We see that Betty is a member of the architecture and agile CoPs, the Architecture Owner on delivery team A, and a member of the Enterprise Architecture team. Fred is a member of the Agile CoE, the agile coach for both delivery team A and B, and a member of the agile and testing CoPs. Barney is a team member on delivery team B and a member of the agile and testing CoPs.

Centers of Excellence (CoEs)

A Center of Excellence (CoE), and sometimes called a Center for Excellence (C4E), is a group of people with specialized skills and expertise whose job is to provide leadership and purposely disseminate that knowledge within your organization. CoEs should not be confused with Communities of Practice (CoPs), discussed later, are sometimes referred to as guilds. In the last few years we’ve seen Agile CoEs, Testing CoEs, DevOps CoEs, and Architecture CoEs created within organizations to help their continuous improvement efforts.
This article addresses the following topics:
•	Why CoEs?
•	Forming a CoE
•	CoEs and Other Teams
 
Why CoEs?
A Center of Excellence (CoE) is typically formed to address a skills/knowledge deficit within an organization. The members of a CoE are typically coaches, so an Agile CoE is a collection of agile coaches, a testing CoE a collection of testing coaches, and so on. CoE coaches will be involved with many of the activities of Continuous Improvement:
1.	Identifying techniques. Coaches will work with one another, and with the people that they are coaching, to identify potential techniques (practices, strategies, principles) that they can help people to adopt to improve the way that they work.
2.	Sharing techniques. Coaches will help practitioners to share techniques that they find effective with one another. Helping to build a learning organization is the primary way for CoE coaches to scale their efforts and better yet work their way out of job.
3.	Capturing techniques. CoE coaches will work with practitioners to capture viable techniques so as to build organizational memory around their processes and strategies.
4.	Supporting teams. The primary mission for CoE coaches is to support individual and team learning. As you can see in the goal diagram below, there is a wide range of strategies available to you.
5.	Organizing CoPs. Very often a CoE will initiate, or at least support the initiation of, one or more communities of practice (CoP) to aid their educational efforts. For example, an Agile CoE may help to organize an Agile CoP, an Agile Testing CoP, a Lean Architecture CoP, and many others.
6.	Governing improvement. A CoE will often collect and track a collection of metrics to help them both govern and to justify your organization’s investment in the CoE.

Forming CoEs
A CoE will be formed by identifying people who have the skills/knowledge, the ability to coach and likely train people, and who have the drive to continue learning on their own. The following table compares and contrasts common strategies for finding CoE coaches.
Strategy	Advantages	Disadvantages
Hire from within	The person is known and (hopefully) respected within your organization
The person knows how to navigate your organizational environment	May not have experienced the CoE’s topic outside of your organization, and as a result may struggle with “that’s the way it’s done here” type issues
May still be wrapped up in the activities of their existing position
Often new to being a CoE coach
Hire new employees	Brings a new viewpoint and fresh experiences into your organization
Often has CoE coaching experience	Can be very hard to find, particularly if you don’t already have people experienced in the CoE topic to help you identify viable candidates
Can be difficult to get rid of a full time employee (FTE) if they don’t work out
Hire consultants/contractors	Easier to find candidates to choose from because many experts choose to become consultants
There may be opportunity to hire the person as a full time employee (FTE) once you’ve tried them out	Difficult to identify this type of person if you don’t already have people experienced in the CoE topic to help you identify viable candidates
CoEs will self organize, and within larger CoEs a Team Lead, often called a CoE Lead, will emerge to guide the team.
CoEs and Other Teams
CoEs have close relationships with, and overlapping membership with, two other types of teams:
1.	Communities of Practice (CoPs). A Community of Practice (CoP) is a collection of people who share a craft or profession who have banded together to ‘learn’ from each other to develop themselves and often even the organization. The primary difference between a CoE and a CoP is that a CoE is often purposefully created by an organization with funded members whose full-time job is to coach, teach, and mentor people whereas CoPs are voluntary efforts that typically aren’t funded. CoPs, because of their voluntary nature, often last much longer than CoEs and may be the end result of a CoE once its official funding disappears.
2.	Work teams. Very often there will be work teams within your organization whose purpose is to perform the some or all of the work activities supported by a CoE. For example, your organization may have an Enterprise Architecture (EA) team (or simply an architecture team) whose actual purpose is to evolve and support your EA strategy. In parallel you may also have an Architecture CoE helping people to learn and share architecture skills and even an Architecture CoP. Note that a CoE is a type of work team.

•	What Is(n’t) Agile Team Governance?
•	Why Agile Team Governance?
•	Strategies that Enable Team Governance
•	Supporting Agile Team Governance
•	Observations About Agile Team Governance
An important, yet seldom discussed, topic is how do you govern agile teams? This is rather strange considering that agile teams are in fact being governed whether you choose to recognize this or not. If someone is keeping an eye on the budget, or the level of quality being produced, or whether you are producing something of value for your stakeholders then you are being governed. If there are defined roles and responsibilities for team members then you’re being governed. If you are following common security or data guidelines, or working towards a common roadmap or strategic outcomes, or providing visibility people outside of your team then you are being governed. The real question, is are you being governed well?
The DA tool kit is one of the few places where governance strategies are an explicit aspect of the overall approach. This includes governance of individual teams as well as governance at the organizational level.  In this article, which is focused on team-level governance, we address the following topics:
1.	What is(n’t) Agile Team Governance?
2.	Why agile team governance?
3.	Strategies that enable team governance
4.	Supporting agile team governance

Streamline Your Processes for Business Agility
The DA™ Tool Kit provides flexible guidance so you can adapt and evolve your process in a context-sensitive manner.
Each business challenge is both unique to your situation and informed by traditional conventions. By using the DA tool kit, you and your team can better understand how seemingly segmented activities can work together in a context-sensitive manner, such as:
•	Solution Delivery
•	IT Operations
•	Enterprise Architecture
•	Portfolio Management
•	Finance
•	Vendor Management, etc.
By understanding what these activities should address, as well as the tradeoffs associated with each, you can make more informed decisions for better business agility.
There are four “process levels” indicated in the diagram
Foundation
The Foundation layer provides the conceptual underpinnings of the DA tool kit.  This includes the DA Mindset; foundational concepts from agile, lean, and serial/traditional ways of working (WoW); people-oriented issues such as roles, responsibilities, and teaming structures; and of course how to choose your WoW.
Disciplined DevOps
Disciplined DevOps is the streamlining of IT solution development and IT operations activities, and supporting enterprise-IT activities, to provide more effective outcomes to an organization.
Value streams
The value streams layer encompasses the capabilities required to provide value streams to your customers.  A value stream is the set of actions that take place to add value to a customer from the initial request through realization of value by the customer. A value stream begins, ends, and hopefully continues with a customer. The value stream begins with the initial concept, moves through various stages for one or more development teams, and on through final delivery and support. It’s not enough to be innovative in ideas if these ideas can’t be realized in the marketplace or in the company. DA FLEX is the glue that ties an organization’s strategies in that it visualizes what an effective value stream looks like, enabling you to make decisions for improving each part of the organization within the context of the whole.
Disciplined Agile Enterprise
A Disciplined Agile Enterprise (DAE) is able to anticipate and respond swiftly to changes in the marketplace. It does this through an organizational culture and structure that facilitates change within the context of the situation that it faces. Such organizations require a learning mindset in the mainstream business and underlying lean and agile processes to drive innovation.

Agile (DA)

Disciplined Agile (DA) is a process-decision toolkit that
provides straightforward guidance to help people, teams,
and organizations to streamline their processes in a
context-sensitive manner in all levels of the organization.
DA provides a solid foundation for business agility by
showing how the various activities such as Solution
Delivery (software development), IT Operations, Enterprise
Architecture, Portfolio Management, Security, Finance,
Procurement and many others work together. DA also
describes what these activities should address, provides a
range of options for doing so, and describes the trade-offs
associated with each option.

Blade

A process blade addresses a specific organizational
capability, such as finance, people management, data
management, agile solution delivery, procurement, and
more.
A process blade encompasses a cohesive collection of
process options – including practices, strategies, and
work flows – that should be chosen and then applied in a
context sensitive manner.

DAD milestones – Lightweight and consistent

Milestone Fundamental Question Asked
Stakeholder vision Do stakeholders agree with yourstrategy?
Proven architecture Can you actually build this?
Continued viability Does the effort still make sense?
Sufficientfunctionality Has the team produced (at least) a minimum
business increment (MBI)?
Production ready Will the solution work in production?
Delighted stakeholders Are stakeholders happy with the deployed solution? 20

Effectiveness
Adopt What Works Abandon What Doesn’t Work
Share Learnings
Some experiments fail.
You learn something, but
it’s still a failure.
Failing fast is fine, but
succeeding early is better.
If we get better at this,
we succeed more often
and we improve faster.
We can do this if we have
access to an experienced
agile coach, but they’re
expensive and hard to find.

We can do this if we have
access to a process
knowledgebase, like the
Disciplined Agile (DA)
toolkit.^21

22
Start where you are,
do the best that you can in the situation that you face,
and always strive to get better.

“Better
Decisions Lead
to Better
Outcomes”
23
Disciplined Agile is a rich, comprehensive and
well-organized toolkit of strategies to help your
organization be more successful with Agile
DA brings a disciplined, agnostic, professional,
enterprise approach to agile which is what our
industry has been lacking in the past
Understanding what your options are, and
which ones work in different contexts leads to
better decisions
Better decisions lead to better outcomes
